# Koa Sessions Test
## Description
This is a basic example of using sessions with Koa that includes:
* Koa Router
* Koa Body Parser
* Custom static file reading middleware that should probably never be used by anyone, but I felt like writing

## To Run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PropetofAtnu/koa-sessions-test.git
cd koa-sessions-test
npm install
npm run start
```
